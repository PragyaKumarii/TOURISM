<img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gateway-of-India-1.jpg">
 <p> <font size="4">Gateway of India, the best place to visit in Mumbai, was built in 1924 by George Willet to honor the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai. Visit this place in the early morning or late evening hours to enjoy the cool breeze of the sea with your family sans the crowd. Located next to the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and facing the vast Arabian Sea, the Gateway of India leaves you spellbound in every way possible. Take a ferry ride offered here to experience a stupendous view of this monument right from the sea and you can also visit other main attractions nearby.</font></P><BR/>

<P><font size="4">And the best part? You donâ€™t have to spend a penny to enjoy the beauty of this iconic monument which is often called the Taj Mahal of Mumbai. And the city has many such places that you can enjoy free of cost.</font></p><br />


<h3 id="MUMBAI">2) Sanjay Gandhi National Park</h3>
<img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sanjay-Gandhi-National-Park-1.jpg">
 <p> <font size="4">Sprawling over an area of 104 sq. km. of land, this is one of the most-visited national parks in Asia and because of this, I give it the 2nd spot among all the best places to visit in Mumbai. With all sorts of fun activities, this park can surely be a family entertainer. You can watch the big cats of the park close enough in a safari cage and have a fun day boating in the artificial lake in the park. Take the forest road or stairs and hike towards the Gandhi Tekdi, a memorial built in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. The toy train, Van Rani, is another popular attraction here, especially among kids. You can also visit the 2000-years-old Kanheri Caves to capture the Buddha relics. The undisturbed natural trails and the Jain Temple in the forest are also sure to make your visit a memorable one.</font></p><br />


<h3 id="MUMBAI">3)Haji Ali Dargah</h3>
<img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Haji-Ali.jpg">
 <p> <font size="4">How about taking a trip with your family to one of the most popular religious shrines in Mumbai, built right in the middle of the Arabian Sea? Yes, we are talking about Haji Ali Dargah that houses the tomb of Sayed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. This grand edifice is made of white marbles and exemplifies the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. A walk through the causeway that connects the Dargah to the Lala Rajput Rai Marg is the main attraction of this place. Feel the spirituality of this place with your dear ones while enjoying a panoramic view of the deep blue waters! I give the places Fab rank no.4 among all the best places to visit in Mumbai.</font></p></b>


<h3 id="MUMBAI">4) Elephanta Caves</h3>
<img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Elephenta-Caves.jpg">
 <p> <font size="4">Take a tour to this UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai and get wonderstruck by the massive rock-cut caves that date back to several centuries. It has five caves dedicated to Hindu god Shiva and two caves depicting Buddhist architectures. To reach this place, you need to take a one-hour ferry ride from the Gateway of India, during which you can also enjoy the scenic beauty of Mumbai. Those who lack the spirit of a trekker can hop on the toy train that will take you on a tour of the caves right from the entry point. The restaurant and canteen run by MTDC can take care of your hunger pangs. If you are planning a one-day tour to the Elephanta Caves, this blog will give you more details.</font></p></b>


<h3 id="MUMBAI">5) Juhu Beach</h3>
<img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Juhu-Beach.jpg">
 <p> <font size="4">Nothing can be more romantic than watching the crimson sun and the luminous orange sky on a breezy beach, with your loved one. Juhu Beach is one such spectacular place in Mumbai, often visited by couples who need a little romantic escape from the humdrum of city life. You can also plan a romantic date night at one of the amazing beachside restaurants available at Juhu.</font></p></b>
